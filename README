        "description": "In their coalition agreement, the Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and the liberal FDP addressed issues from climate protection to foreign policy to cannabis. As the German parliament gets ready to formally elect the SPD’s Olaf Scholz as chancellor on Wednesday, here are the main points of the new coalition’s roadmap.READ ALSO: No new debt Germany’s no-new-debt rule had been suspended in the coronavirus pandemic, allowing the government to borrow billions to finance its way out of the crisis.But the country’s next government – known as a “traffic-light” coalition because of the parties’ red, green and yellow colours – plans a return to the rule that is anchored in the German constitution.In their agreement, they pledged to reinstate the so-called debt brake by 2023.Maintaining the debt brake was a red line for the FDP, and Social Democrat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz – who will be Germany’s next chancellor – has also long been an advocate of the rule.The parties also agreed to not raise taxes during their mandate, according to a tweet by FDP leader Christian Lindner – a win for his party which has refused to raise any fiscal pressure on taxpayers.READ ALSO: OPINION: Germany is showing the world it can do grown-up politics(article continues below)Minimum wage, housing, vote at 16In return, the Social Democrats secured their electoral promise of raising the minimum wage to €12 ($14) from the current €9.60.To keep housing affordable, the coalition agreed to build 400,000 new homes a year, including 100,000 using public funds. A cap will be introduced on\nrental hikes, limiting any increases to a maximum 11 percent in three years.The three-party combo also agreed to lower the voting age to 16 – something likely to favour the Greens and FDP which have younger supporters than Angela Merkel’s conservatives (CDU/CSU), who are largely backed by Germany’s army of pensioners.Citizenship and immigrationGermany’s incoming coalition is much more immigration friendly than the outgoing government led by Merkel’s conservatives.The coalition parties want to overhaul and modernise the immigration system, with promises to “simplify the path to German citizenship”.In their initial agreement, they said the plans are to allow for “multiple citizenships” – which is music to the ears of many foreigners in the Bundesrepublik. The existing rules require that most non-EU citizens have to give up their other citizenship if they want to become German.READ MORE: Germany’s new coalition government to allow dual nationalityClimate The Greens’ main win came in the form of an accelerated exit from coal energy, which is to be brought forward by eight years to 2030.The parties also agreed to “further develop” the country’s current climate protection law in 2022, and to “bring about all necessary laws, regulations and measures” on this front.The expansion of sustainable energy will be “drastically accelerated and all hurdles and obstacles will be removed”, with the goal of ensuring that sustainable energy will make up 80 percent of the country’s mix by 2030.“All suitable roof surfaces will in future be used for solar energy. For new commercial properties that will be compulsory, while for private new buildings, that will become the rule,” they said.With an eye on Germany’s powerful automotive industry, the parties agreed to put 15 million purely electric cars on the road by 2030, up from just over 500,000 currently.Combustion engine vehicles will no longer receive approval from 2035.Sovereign EuropeThe parties emphatically say they “want to increase Europe’s strategic sovereignty” — likely to please the continent’s second biggest power France, which has made this a priority of its EU presidency beginning in 2022.But the transatlantic relationship will remain a “central pillar” for Germany, and NATO is an “indispensable element” for the country’s security, the text says.And potentially grating to Poland or Hungary, the parties want “an EU which protects its values and rule of law internally and externally”.Presenting the coalition deal, Annalena Baerbock, the co-leader of the Greens who will take on the role of foreign minister, promised to put human rights back at the centre of German diplomacy and advocated more firmness towards Russia and China.Legalise cannabisRecreational use of cannabis will be legalised under the new government.“We will introduce the controlled distribution to adults for consumption purposes in licensed stores,” the parties say in the document.“This will control the quality, prevent the circulation of contaminated substances and ensure the protection of minors.”The Greens and FDP have long been pushing to legalise cannabis, while the SPD has proposed testing regulated distribution of the drug in pilot projects.READ ALSO: How Germany’s next government is planning to legalise cannabisAbortionThe parties have pledged to abolish paragraph 219a, a controversial piece of Nazi-era legislation that makes it illegal to advertise abortion services.“Doctors should be able to provide public information about abortions without fear of prosecution,” they say in the document.",

            "description": "The new coalition government made up of the Social Democrats, Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) have set out an agreement with the aim of modernising Germany. Here’s the financial impact their plans could have on households and consumers in the coming months and years. READ ALSO:Low income earners to get more There’s good news for people who earn the minimum wage (Mindestlohn): it will jump from the current €9.60 to €12 per hour. This is likely to happen in the coming months. Furthermore, the earnings limit for mini-jobs will rise from €450 to €520, and for midi-jobs to €1,600 (from the current €1,300).A mini-job is a position in Germany where the employee earns no more than a certain amount each month, allowing people to work fewer hours free of tax. A midijobbber, which also belongs to the category of low-income earners, receives a reduced tax burden.Taxes, ‘spouse’ splitting, savingsThe traffic light parties haven’t agreed on a fundamental tax reform. But there are some changes.Ehegattensplitting, which refers to how married couples’ income taxes are calculated under the German law, with tax classes 3 and 5 is to be abolished in future.This regulation, which has been in place since the 1950s, is said to have pushed many women into low-income jobs.(article continues below)Moreover, the lower earner (mostly women) pays more tax than the partner with the higher income. Instead of ‘spouse splitting’, a so-called real splitting is to be introduced.In future, married couples will be assessed individually on their income tax returns.The coalition agreement states: “We want to further develop family taxation in such a way that partnership responsibility and economic independence are strengthened with regard to all forms of families.”READ ALSO: Ehegattensplitting: How did Germany’s marriage tax law get so controversial?Meanwhile, savers can expect relief. The savers’ allowance is to be raised from €801 to €1,000 for singles and from €1,602 to €2000 for couples – but not until 2023.This would be the first increase in the allowance since 2007. Plus, the education allowance is to rise from €924 to €1,200. The ‘home office’ allowance, introduced in the pandemic due to so many people working from home, will be extended until the end of 2022.Tax boostsThe new German government plans to put in place some tax relief, with the aim of benefitting single parents, families with children and people caring for relatives in particular. The coalition also wants to reform land transfer tax. RentingThe coalition partners do not plan a rent freeze which would see rents fall down and massive relief for tenants. The parties instead say they will extend the rent brake until 2029. That means that tenants can challenge their landlords to lower the rent prices, but it can often involve lengthy court cases so has been criticised. Landlords will soon only be allowed to hike up rents in tight housing markets (like Berlin or Munich) by a maximum of 11 percent in three years. Currently, the cap is 20 percent in general and 15 percent in districts with a tight market.The coalition has set themselves the goal of building 400,000 new flats per year in Germany, with 100,000 of them publicly subsidised. They say this will ease the rental crisis.Energy pricesThe recent sharp rise in energy prices has put a heavy burden on many people across Germany. This is one of the reasons why the CO2 price will no longer be paid for by tenants alone. From June 2022, landlords will have to contribute, either in the form of a graduated model according to building energy classes or by paying half the amount.The new government partners also want to provide relief on electricity prices by abolishing the EEG levy. After the agreed reduction in January 2022 (from 6.5 cents to around 3.7 cents per kilowatt hour), the EEG levy will no longer be paid for by households in their electricity bills from 2023 and will be paid out of the federal government budget.But since the CO2 price on fossil fuels will continue to rise, experts expect energy to become more expensive, which will hit most consumers despite all the planned relief. The new government wants to set up a new fund to help hard-up families.Food costsRising energy prices could also make food more expensive in the coming years, as we’ve already seen in Germany.The coalition parties plan to launch a so-called “nutrition strategy” by 2023, with the aim of ensuring that the share of regional and organic products grows, food waste is reduced and plant-based meat alternatives are promoted.Meanwhile, cheap food is to be put under closer scrutiny. The coalition agreement states: “We will take action against unfair trade practices and examine whether the sale of food below production costs can be prevented.” Particularly cheap meat, as currently offered by discounters, could become more expensive in future.Unemployment support will changeThe new coalition wants to replace income support (known as Hartz IV), with a so-called citizen’s income – or Bürgergeld.At the moment we still don’t have many details about this, though the main change will likely be that people won’t be immediately assessed on the size of their living space or savings when they apply for financial assistance. Other than that, parties haven’t said when it will happen, how the new system will work, or how much money people will get – though it’s unlikely to be much of a payrise for the unemployed.PensionsAs Germans live longer while also having less children – and the babyboomers retire – the demographic makeup of society is changing dramatically. While the proportion of working age people to retirees is currently three to one, it is expected to increase to three to two by the year 2060.So what does the country do about pensions?The coalition has vowed to maintain state pensions at 48 percent of average salaries, with contributions capped at 20 percent of gross pay. This will not rise in the coming legislative period. According to the coalition agreement, there will be no pension cuts or a higher retirement age.In a bid to keep these promises in the long term, the coalition wants to supplement pension system by a private provision based on shares. The agreement states that “this partial capital cover is to be professionally managed as a permanent fund by an independent body under public law and invested globally”.  Many details are, however, still unclear at this stage.",

(تتواصل المقالة أدناه) علاوة على ذلك ، يدفع صاحب الدخل المنخفض (معظمه من النساء) ضرائب أكثر من الشريك صاحب الدخل المرتفع. بدلاً من \"تقسيم الزوج\" ، يجب تقديم ما يسمى بالانقسام الحقيقي. في المستقبل ، سيتم تقييم الأزواج بشكل فردي على إقرارات ضريبة الدخل الخاصة بهم. تنص اتفاقية الائتلاف على ما يلي: \"نريد زيادة تطوير الضرائب العائلية بهذه الطريقة أن مسؤولية الشراكة والاستقلال الاقتصادي تتعزز فيما يتعلق بجميع أشكال الأسر. اقرأ أيضًا: تقسيم Ehegattens: كيف أصبح قانون ضريبة الزواج مثيرًا للجدل؟ سيتم رفع بدل المدخرين من 801 يورو إلى 1000 يورو للأفراد ومن 1602 يورو إلى 2000 يورو للأزواج - ولكن ليس حتى عام 2023 ، وستكون هذه أول زيادة في المخصصات منذ عام 2007. بالإضافة إلى ذلك ، فإن بدل التعليم هو يرتفع من 924 يورو إلى 1200 يورو. سيتم تمديد بدل \"مكتب المنزل\" ، الذي تم إدخاله في الوباء بسبب عمل الكثير من الأشخاص من المنزل ، حتى نهاية عام 2022. والأسر التي لديها أطفال والأشخاص الذين يعتنون بأقاربهم على وجه الخصوص. كما يريد التحالف إصلاح ضريبة نقل ملكية الأراضي. لا يخطط شركاء التحالف لتجميد الإيجارات مما قد يؤدي إلى انخفاض الإيجارات وإغاثة كبيرة للمستأجرين. يقول الطرفان بدلاً من ذلك إنهم سيمددون فرملة الإيجار حتى عام 2029. وهذا يعني أنه يمكن للمستأجرين تحدي أصحاب العقارات لخفض أسعار الإيجار ، ولكن يمكن أن يشمل ذلك غالبًا قضايا قضائية مطولة ، لذلك تم انتقاد هذا الأمر. قريباً ، سيتم السماح لمالكي العقارات برفع الإيجارات في أسواق الإسكان الضيقة (مثل برلين أو ميونيخ) بحد أقصى 11 في المائة في غضون ثلاث سنوات. حاليًا ، يبلغ الحد الأقصى 20 في المائة بشكل عام و 15 في المائة في المناطق ذات السوق الضيقة ، وقد حدد التحالف هدفه المتمثل في بناء 400 ألف شقة جديدة سنويًا في ألمانيا ، منها 100 ألف شقة مدعومة من الحكومة. يقولون إن هذا سيخفف من أزمة الإيجارات. أسعار الطاقة أدى الارتفاع الحاد الأخير في أسعار الطاقة إلى وضع عبء ثقيل على عاتق العديد من الناس في جميع أنحاء ألمانيا. هذا هو أحد أسباب عدم دفع ثمن ثاني أكسيد الكربون من قبل المستأجرين وحدهم. اعتبارًا من يونيو 2022 ، سيتعين على أصحاب العقارات المساهمة ، إما في شكل نموذج متدرج وفقًا لفئات الطاقة في المبنى أو عن طريق دفع نصف المبلغ ، كما يرغب شركاء الحكومة الجدد في تخفيف أسعار الكهرباء عن طريق إلغاء ضريبة EEG. بعد التخفيض المتفق عليه في يناير 2022 (من 6.5 سنتًا إلى حوالي 3.7 سنتًا للكيلوواط / ساعة) ، لن يتم دفع ضريبة EEG من قبل الأسر في فواتير الكهرباء الخاصة بهم اعتبارًا من عام 2023 وسيتم دفعها من ميزانية الحكومة الفيدرالية ، ولكن منذ ذلك الحين نظرًا لأن سعر ثاني أكسيد الكربون على الوقود الأحفوري سيستمر في الارتفاع ، يتوقع الخبراء أن تصبح الطاقة أكثر تكلفة ، وهو ما سيؤثر على معظم المستهلكين على الرغم من كل عمليات الإغاثة المخطط لها. تريد الحكومة الجديدة إنشاء صندوق جديد لمساعدة العائلات المتعسرة. تكاليف الغذاء يمكن أن يؤدي ارتفاع أسعار الطاقة أيضًا إلى زيادة تكلفة الغذاء في السنوات المقبلة ، كما رأينا بالفعل في ألمانيا ، وتخطط أحزاب التحالف لإطلاق ما يلي- \"استراتيجية التغذية\" بحلول عام 2023 ، بهدف البدائل التي تعرض زيادة حصة المنتجات الإقليمية والعضوية ، يُطلق على نفايات الطعام تسمية اللحوم ذات الأصل النباتي والترويج لها. وفي الوقت نفسه ، يجب وضع الطعام الرخيص تحت الفحص الدقيق. ينص اتفاق التحالف على ما يلي: \"سنتخذ إجراءات ضد الممارسات التجارية غير العادلة ونفحص ما إذا كان يمكن منع بيع المواد الغذائية بأقل من تكاليف الإنتاج\". يمكن أن تصبح اللحوم الرخيصة بشكل خاص ، كما يتم تقديمها حاليًا من خلال الخصومات ، أكثر تكلفة في المستقبل.سيتغير دعم البطالة - يريد الائتلاف الجديد استبدال دعم الدخل (المعروف باسم Hartz IV) ، بما يسمى دخل المواطن - أو Bürgergeld في الوقت الحالي ، ما زلنا لا نملك الكثير من التفاصيل حول هذا الأمر ، على الرغم من أن التغيير الرئيسي سيكون على الأرجح أنه لن يتم تقييم الأشخاص على الفور بناءً على حجم مساحة معيشتهم أو مدخراتهم عند التقدم للحصول على المساعدة المالية. بخلاف ذلك ، لم تقل الأحزاب متى سيحدث ذلك ، أو كيف سيعمل النظام الجديد ، أو مقدار الأموال التي سيحصل عليها الناس - على الرغم من أنه من غير المرجح أن يكون ذلك بمثابة زيادة كبيرة في رواتب العاطلين عن العمل. الأطفال - والمولودون يتقاعدون - يتغير التركيب الديموغرافي للمجتمع بشكل كبير. في حين أن نسبة الأشخاص في سن العمل إلى المتقاعدين هي حاليًا ثلاثة إلى واحد ، فمن المتوقع أن ترتفع إلى ثلاثة إلى اثنين بحلول عام 2060. متوسط ​​الرواتب ، مع تحديد المساهمات بنسبة 20 في المائة من إجمالي الأجر. لن يرتفع هذا في الفترة التشريعية المقبلة. وفقًا لاتفاق الائتلاف ، لن يكون هناك تخفيضات في المعاشات التقاعدية أو سن تقاعد أعلى ، وفي محاولة للوفاء بهذه الوعود على المدى الطويل ، يريد الائتلاف استكمال نظام التقاعد بحكم خاص قائم على الأسهم. وتنص الاتفاقية على أن \"هذا الغطاء الرأسمالي الجزئي يجب إدارته بشكل احترافي كصندوق دائم من قبل هيئة مستقلة بموجب القانون العام ويتم استثماره عالميًا\". العديد من التفاصيل ، ومع ذلك ، لا تزال غير واضحة في هذه المرحلة ..",

After the agreed reduction in January 2022 (from 6.5 cents to around 3.7 cents per kilowatt hour), the EEG levy will no longer be paid for by households in their electricity bills from 2023 and will be paid out of the federal government budget.But since the CO2 price on fossil fuels will continue to rise, experts expect energy to become more expensive, which will hit most consumers despite all the planned relief. The new government wants to set up a new fund to help hard-up families.Food costsRising energy prices could also make food more expensive in the coming years, as we’ve already seen in Germany.The coalition parties plan to launch a so-called “nutrition strategy” by 2023, with the aim of ensuring that the share of regional and organic products grows, food waste is reduced and plant-based meat alternatives are promoted.Meanwhile, cheap food is to be put under closer scrutiny. The coalition agreement states: “We will take action against unfair trade practices and examine whether the sale of food below production costs can be prevented.” Particularly cheap meat, as currently offered by discounters, could become more expensive in future.Unemployment support will changeThe new coalition wants to replace income support (known as Hartz IV), with a so-called citizen’s income – or Bürgergeld.At the moment we still don’t have many details about this, though the main change will likely be that people won’t be immediately assessed on the size of their living space or savings when they apply for financial assistance. Other than that, parties haven’t said when it will happen, how the new system will work, or how much money people will get – though it’s unlikely to be much of a payrise for the unemployed.PensionsAs Germans live longer while also having less children – and the babyboomers retire – the demographic makeup of society is changing dramatically. While the proportion of working age people to retirees is currently three to one, it is expected to increase to three to two by the year 2060.So what does the country do about pensions?The coalition has vowed to maintain state pensions at 48 percent of average salaries, with contributions capped at 20 percent of gross pay. This will not rise in the coming legislative period. According to the coalition agreement, there will be no pension cuts or a higher retirement age.In a bid to keep these promises in the long term, the coalition wants to supplement pension system by a private provision based on shares. The agreement states that “this partial capital cover is to be professionally managed as a permanent fund by an independent body under public law and invested globally”.  Many details are, however, still unclear at this stage.",
